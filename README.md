Project Description :
Retail inventory management is the process of ensuring you carry products that shoppers want, with neither too little nor too much on hand.
By managing inventory, retailers meet customer demand without running out of stock or carrying excess supply. Inventory management is vital
for retailers because the practice helps them increase profits.

They are more likely to have enough inventory to capture every possible sale while avoiding overstock because too much inventory means working capital costs, operational costs, and a complex operation.
Based on the inventory management analysis we can manage how much inventory is required for selling the product based on which they can calculate the profit and losses.

Our dataset contains a lot of historical sales data of a Brazilian top retailer

Basic Questions of every retailer : How much inventory should I carry? Too much inventory means working capital costs, operational costs and a complex operation, lack of inventory leads to lost sales, unhappy customers and a damaged brand.

This is why short-term forecasting is so important in the retail and consumer goods industry.
